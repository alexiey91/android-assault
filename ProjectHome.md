In this project, we will provide a powerful tool for analyzers to analyze the Android malware samples manually. To implement a prototype GUI to aide static analysis, I’d like to use PyQT as the framework of the prototype. Because PyQT provides a complete interface to QT applications and python can interact with androguard easily. We can reuse some androguard’s codes.

The important features of our tool are listed as follows: (1) Graph-based UI displaying control flow of the code. (2) Links from graph view to source view. (3) Function/Object - > Method list and filter. (4) Strings list and Filter. (5) Flow in/out from a given point. (6) Function and variable renaming. Additional features are: (8) Syntax highlighting. (9) Find the UI Dialog before trigger the suspicious API.
